Keeping track of what goes in and out at Prerna Sewa Sansthan home for the homeless
through manually using paper folders and file registers can be error prone and so to help
the organisation work at the best of their ability and to help them also help the homeless
people effectively they will need to manage their data properly. I will need to help them
come up with a database that will help them achieve data management efficiently and one
that will help them track well. Being an NGO they should opt for a free RDBMS or one with a
less price which will help save money needed for even more important tasks.
